  <h1 class="jumbo">WHO ARE WE? ANARCHY!</h1>
  <p>Austin is the city that began the modern roller derby renaissance. By 2013, the women of central Texas had already been competing and bouting for over a decade. They traveled the world and won world championships. Roller Derby had grown into the greatest sport on the planet. In January 2013 a group of Austin area men began practicing roller derby; hungry for the challenge, passion and hard hits of the sport.</p>
  <p>Thus, Austin Anarchy was born! We are Austin’s first and only men’s roller derby team. Within the span of 6 months, Austin Anarchy went from ragtag skating on old basketball courts to playing bouts. From varying skating backgrounds, we strive to push our athleticism and continue the growth of the flat track movement in Austin and beyond. In March 2015, Austin Anarchy was accepted into the <a href="http://www.mensrollerderbyassociation.com/">Men’s Roller Derby Association (MRDA)</a>. We play teams both regionally and nationally. As a 501(c)(3) organization, Austin Anarchy is a skater and volunteer run organization.</p>
