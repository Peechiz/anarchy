# Austin Anarchy

A new webapp for the Austin Men's Flat Track Roller Derby Team

## Goals and Objectives

ATX Anarchy's current website is a static wordpress with minimal functionality and a design that doesn't leverage the team's aesthetic.  With that in mind, it was my intention to create a more visually pleasing design that also provided functionality that might be usefull to the team.

I'm currently consulting with them to improve the site, currently hosted on Heroku.

## Planned Features

- [x] Skater Profiles
- [ ] Admin Panel
  - [x] Full skaters CRUD
  - [ ] View pending skater applications
  - [ ] Front Page editing
- [ ] New Skater Application
- [ ] Calendar (supporting public/private events, Admin/Author permission editing)
- [ ] Blog/Bout Recap

## Known Issues
- Navigation bar will sometimes fail to highlite (nav controller refactor needed)
- Gear display image sometimes cuts off the bottom `<hr>`
- Teams view styling needs to be fully mocked up / improved
